Hostel Management System in C++ with two Password protected profiles, an admin and a user profile
Used fstream.h library to read, write and manage the data received as input by user or the warden in a .DAT file
Made an appealing and user-friendly interface with limited resources present in TurboC++ like the dos.h library
Added various functionalities like allotting hostels to new registrants, editing, deleting, finding user data
